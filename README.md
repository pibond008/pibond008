## About Me

I am a Master's student in Astrophysics and Particle Physics at the University of Tübingen with a strong focus on numerical simulations, scientific computing, and experimental physics.

My work centers around:

- Numerical relativity and compact object simulations  
- High-performance computational workflows  
- Reproducible research-grade software  
- Performance-aware Python/Fortran pipelines  
- Optical system characterization and precision measurement analysis  

I am particularly interested in roles involving simulation engineering, scientific software development, computational modeling, and data-intensive technical systems.
